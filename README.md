# QA_RAG_Langchain_AdvancedRetriever
hands-on project applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to a real-world use case: interpreting LICâ€™s New Jeevan Shanti policy document using LLMs.

The core idea? Combine vector search over regulatory PDFs with GPT-4 to generate grounded, faithful answers to complex policy questions.

Key capabilities we built:
âœ… LCEL-based RAG architecture using LangChain
âœ… Contextual compression retriever for focused document lookup
âœ… Modular LLM & embedding selection (OpenAI, HuggingFace, Mistral)
âœ… Evaluation using LLM-powered metrics: faithfulness, relevance, correctness

ðŸ“„ The document used is publicly available here:
LIC New Jeevan Shanti Policy PDF

ðŸ’¡ This architecture brings the best of both worlds â€” retrieval accuracy and generative flexibility â€” especially in regulated domains like insurance and financial services.
